# Advent of Code 2022 aka Lef tries Scala

Let's try this Scala thing that all the cool data kids are talking about.

## Setup 🛠️

A `Makefile` is provided, you can run `make setup-mac` if you're on macOS.

## Run 🏃‍♂️

```shell
./run number_of_day_to_run
```

Example to run day 1: `./run 1`

Else within `sbt`:

1. Run `sbt` in your terminal to start
2. To run the scripts in `sbt` do: `run number_of_day` e.g. `run 1` to run the 1st day
